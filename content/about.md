Hi! I am Rajat! 

I am working at Smart IOPS on their low latency firmware for an ultra low-latency SLC SSD. 

Fun facts about me:
  * I am a heartfulness practitioner!
  * I recently started watching anime and I have not seen anything un-animated for about an year. I have revised Haikyu 16 times!
  * I love running! I am currently training myself to complete a 5K run in under 30 minutes. Then to bring that time under 16 minutes.
  * MUSE is my favorite band.

On the side, I am working on a handheld a space invader like handheld video game using TM4C123 Launcpad.
